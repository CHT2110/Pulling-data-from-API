# Pulling-data-from-API
I pull data from "the one API" which is a simple API that contains information on the Lord of the rings franchise. 

# Description
The script pulls data from "the one API", specifically data about the various lord of the rings movies and the hobbit series. 
I access the API through a bearer token and pull the “movie” data by editing the API header with the “/movie” parameter (check documentation for more information). 
Besides that, I inspect the keys from the JSON file and save the data I needed into a dataframe to see all the data about the different movies. 

# Result 
I pulled the following columns with the script:
•	ID
•	Name
•	Runtime in minutes
•	Budget in millions 
•	Box office revenue in millions 
•	Award nominations 
•	Award wins 
•	Rotten tomatoes score
